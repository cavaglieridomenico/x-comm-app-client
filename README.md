<h3>Yes, but who are we?</h3>
<p>
We are student members of the TommorwDevs community.
In fact, the purpose of this project is to simulate a real world situation by working in teams.

<h2>Technology Choice</h2>
<p>
One of the specifications of the project was that we could not use the same technologies.
<i>This pushed us to go out of our comfort zone.</i>

In order to choose the technologies to be used, such as the programming language or the choice of the Database, more suitable to the specifications of our project we used an <b>Architecture Decision Record (ADR)</b>, a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. <br>
You can find the documents used in the <code>docs/ADR/</code> folder.
</p>

<br>

<h2>Database Model</h2>
<p>
The entityâ€“relationship model (ER model) that shows the relationships of entity sets stored in a database.
