Technical Story: {description | ticket/issue URL} <!-- optional -->

## Context and Problem Statement
To create a webapp that allows the user to upload a file > 2gb and gives the chance to query.

## Decision Drivers

* Speed, due to file's size.
* Ease of learning
* Community's support
* Fit for the project's purpose
* Steadiness

## Considered Options

* GO 
* C#
* NodeJS


## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "{option 1}", because {justification. e.g., only option, which meets k.o. criterion decision driver | which resolves force {force} | … | comes out best (see below)}.

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

* {e.g., improvement of quality attribute satisfaction, follow-up decisions required, …}
* …

### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

* {e.g., compromising quality attribute, follow-up decisions required, …}
* …

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Go
*Pro*
- Very fast.
- Easy to understand, clear syntax.
- Provides heaps of libraries with no need to use the from third parties.
- Safe, including a Garbage Collector that helps preventing loss of memory in the code.
- Excellent with APIs, scalability e performance for heavy APIs.
- Libreria standard multithread che utilizza tutti i core del processore senza moduli aggiuntivi. Standard multithread library that exploits all processor's cores without additional modules.
- Alternative option to C++, easier to learn and code, optimized to execute on multicore CPUs.

*Cons*
- It's a young language.
- Lack of MV, Go's files' size often outclass other languages' one.
